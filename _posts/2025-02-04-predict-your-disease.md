# Disease Prediction System


The **Disease Prediction System** is an AI-powered web application designed to predict diseases based on user-provided symptoms. Built with Flask, Python, and machine learning, this system provides an intuitive interface for users to select their symptoms and receive a predicted diagnosis. The project is deployed on **Render** and is accessible online.

## Live Demo

You can access the live application here:  
ðŸ‘‰ [https://know-your-disease.onrender.com](https://know-your-disease.onrender.com)

---

## Features

- **Symptom Selection**: Users can select multiple symptoms from a searchable dropdown list.
- **AI-Powered Prediction**: The system uses a trained machine learning model to predict the most likely disease based on the selected symptoms.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and responsive design ensures a seamless user experience.
- **Real-Time Results**: Predictions are displayed instantly after submitting the form.
- **Deployed on Render**: The application is hosted on Render for easy access.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Bootstrap for responsive design
  - Select2 for searchable dropdowns
- **Backend**:
  - Flask (Python web framework)
- **Machine Learning**:
  - Scikit-learn for model training and prediction
  - Joblib for model serialization
- **Deployment**:
  - Render for hosting the Flask application

---

## How It Works

1. **Symptom Selection**: Users select their symptoms from a dropdown list. The list is searchable, making it easy to find specific symptoms.
2. **Feature Vector Creation**: The selected symptoms are converted into a binary feature vector, where each symptom is represented as `1` (present) or `0` (absent).
3. **Model Prediction**: The feature vector is passed to the trained machine learning model, which predicts the most likely disease.
4. **Result Display**: The predicted disease is displayed to the user in real-time.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on **Render**, a cloud platform for hosting web applications. The deployment process involves:

1. Pushing the code to a GitHub repository.
2. Connecting the repository to Render.
3. Configuring the build and start commands.
4. Deploying the application.

## Future Enhancements

- **Expand Symptom List**: Add more symptoms to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Multi-Disease Prediction**: Allow the model to predict multiple possible diseases.
- **User Accounts**: Enable users to save their symptom history and predictions.
- **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile version of the application for easier access.
