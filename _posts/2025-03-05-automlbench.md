# **Introducing AutoMLBench: Automating the Machine Learning Pipeline**

### Overview
Machine learning can be complex and time-consuming, especially when it comes to data preparation, model selection, and performance evaluation. **AutoMLBench** is a Python library designed to automate the entire machine learning workflow, from data loading to performance visualization. Whether you are a data scientist, machine learning engineer, or an enthusiast, AutoMLBench simplifies the ML pipeline while maintaining flexibility and control.

### Key Features
- **Data Loading:** Supports multiple file formats, including CSV, Excel, JSON, Parquet, and HDF5.
- **Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, feature scaling, and categorical encoding.
- **Model Training:** Includes predefined machine learning models like Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and more.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Uses GridSearchCV for optimizing model parameters.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Computes Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC.
- **Performance Visualization:** Generates insightful plots for model comparison.
- **Logging & Execution Time Tracking:** Ensures efficient debugging and benchmarking.

### Installation
You can install AutoMLBench directly from PyPI:
```bash
pip install automlbench
```

For local development, clone the repository and install it in editable mode:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnnNaserNabil/automlbench.git
cd automlbench
pip install -e .
```

### Modules Overview
AutoMLBench is built with modularity in mind, ensuring that each step in the ML pipeline is well-structured and reusable.

| Module                   | Functionality |
|--------------------------|--------------|
| `data_loader.py`        | Loads data from multiple file formats. |
| `preprocessing.py`      | Prepares data by handling missing values and encoding categorical features. |
| `models.py`             | Provides various machine learning models. |
| `model_train.py`        | Trains models with class balancing and performance evaluation. |
| `hyperparameter_tuning.py` | Optimizes models using GridSearchCV. |
| `evaluation.py`         | Computes performance metrics. |
| `visualization.py`      | Generates comparative performance plots. |
| `utils.py`              | Logs execution time and messages. |
| `__init__.py`          | Provides easy imports for core functionalities. |

### How It Works
#### 1. Load Your Data
```python
from automlbench import load_data

data = load_data("data.csv")
```
#### 2. Preprocess Data
```python
from automlbench import preprocess_data

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = preprocess_data(data, target_column="label")
```
#### 3. Train Models
```python
from automlbench import get_models, train_models

models = get_models()
results = train_models(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, selected_models=["Random Forest", "XGBoost"])
```
#### 4. Evaluate Performance
```python
from automlbench import evaluate_model

evaluation = evaluate_model(models["Random Forest"], X_test, y_test)
print(evaluation)
```
#### 5. Visualize Performance
```python
from automlbench import plot_performance

plot_performance(results)
```
