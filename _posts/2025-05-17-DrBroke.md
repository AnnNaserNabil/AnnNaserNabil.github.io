### 🌸 Overview

**Dr\_Broke** is not your typical chatbot. It’s a collective of four emotionally intelligent agents trained to guide Bengali-speaking users through the painful but transformative process of healing from heartbreak.

This project combines deep empathy with tailored routines and multilingual NLP to offer a truly personal experience—all through your browser.

### 💡 Why This Matters

Heartbreak is universal—but emotional support in your own language, infused with cultural nuance, is rare. Dr\_Broke bridges that gap by offering Bengali speakers a space where AI listens with care, speaks their language, and walks them gently (or firmly) toward healing.

This is not just an app—it’s an emotional sanctuary powered by AI.
